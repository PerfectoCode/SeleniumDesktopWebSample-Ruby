# Ruby Web Automation Code Sample

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/PerfectoCode/WebAutomationSampleRuby.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/PerfectoCode/WebAutomationSampleRuby)

This code sample demonstrates how to use Perfecto Web Machines & Selenium + Ruby programing language in order to execute tests 
for your web applications on the cloud. 

### Getting Stated: 
- Clone or download the sample:<br/> `git clone https://github.com/PerfectoCode/WebAutomationSampleRuby.git`
- Add your Perfecto Lab credentials within the [WebAppE2E.rb](WebAppE2E.rb) file:
```Ruby
...
@@User = ENV['user']
@@Pass = ENV['password']
@@Host = ENV['host']
@@token = 'MyAuthToken'
... 
```
Note! you may want to use env variable for your credentials as demonstrated
- Run the project from your IDE or using command line `ruby WebAppE2E.rb`

### Web Capabilities: 

- To insure your tests run on Perfecto Web machines on the cloud use the capabilities as demonstrated in the code sample: <br/>
```Ruby
@BeforeMethod
def setup
capabilities = {
    platformName: 'Windows',
    platformVersion: '10',
    browserName: 'Chrome',
    browserVersion: '58',
    resolution: '1280x1024',
    user: @@User,
    password: @@Pass
}
_url = 'http://' + @@Host + '/nexperience/perfectomobile/wd/hub'
```

- More capabilities are available, read more [here](http://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Supported+Platforms).

- To enable Turbo Web Automation in this code sample follow the instructions in the link above in order to generate authentication token.
Place the authentication in [WebAppE2E.rb](WebAppE2E.rb) file::
```Ruby
# For Perfecto Turbo Web solution follow the instructions at http://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Turbo+Web+Automation
# Enable the following lines of code to enable Turbo Web:
# _url += '/fast'
# capabilities['securityToken'] = @@token
```
